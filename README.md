# Howtos - A community collection of programming/system administration tutorials

Have some free time, and want to use your expertise to enable other peoples' education? You're at the right place. Simply take a little bit of time to write up some bit of programming or system administration knowledge, and submit a pull request. Work with project maintainers to ensure your PR can be merged as soon as possible.

## Content Wishlist
 - Collections of valuable community links for learning about common languages, toolkits, libraries, APIs, utilities, etc.
 - "Getting Started" articles for any of the top 20 (or so) programming languages.
 - Easily understandable example programs doing interesting things, along with detailed explanations of how they work.
 - A nice logo for this project

## Rules for contributions
1. DO contribute original content, make _substantive_ additions to existing content (on the scale of a paragraph of valuable new material), or fixing a significant bug/mistake.

1. DO create new Markdown-formatted articles in a directory that is representative of the broad category -- Either the name of the programming language (e.g., bash, C++, etc.), toolkit/library/API (e.g., Qt, Gtk, S3), utility (e.g. awk, emacs, git, wireshark), or whatever makes sense.

1. DO liberally link to external community or project documentation for your tutorial's content.

1. DO list your github username as a co-author of the article, whether you are creating or modifying an article. You can also include your name and email address if you wish.

1. DO NOT make a single small refining commit to existing content -- These will be discarded. If you have suggestions for small improvements to an article, file an issue instead. This will help cut down on spam PRs.

1. DO NOT reuse any content (either prose or code) from other works.

1. DO search through open PRs to determine if someone has already started working on something you want to do. Feel free to target adjacent topics to ensure minimal overlap.
