# Vim Plugins

Vim is an enormously configurable editor, but you don't need thousands of lines
of opaque VimScript copied from who-knows-where.  Here we'll introduce a common
system for managing Vim plugins, as well as a list of important plugins you
will likely wish to install.

## Plugin managers and vim-plug

Most software beyond a certain level of extensibility includes a package
manager for installing and updating packages. Vim 8 and NeoVim include package
managers natively, and you can learn about your editor's support with the
command `:h packages`.  However, vim users have other third party options.
Three of the most well-known are:

* [junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* [tpope/pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [VundleVim/vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

vim-plug is particularly easy to install and use.  The vim-plug wiki has [some
VimScript](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/tips#automatic-installation)
for you to paste in your vimrc which will automatically download and install
the plugin.
